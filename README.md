# Tudor_paper

### Dir ML_trees:
IQTREE outputs for the 10 ML replicates + topology evaluation file. Replicates considered in the paper are rooted. For the three replicates excluded, the raw IQTREE output is present.
  
### Dir HMM_profiles:
HMM profiles for each OG used to build the distance matrix for the NJ tree
  
###  Dir Alignments:
Single-OG alignments, comprehending all sequences before subsampling (see Materials and Methods). All alignments were later merged and realigned altogether with MAFFT-DASH, previous to ML tree inference
