# Tudor_paper

<h4>Dir ML_trees:</h4> IQTREE outputs for the 10 ML replicates + topology evaluation file. Replicates considered in the paper are rooted. For the three replicates excluded, the raw IQTREE output is present.
<h4>Dir HMM_profiles:</h4> HMM profiles for each OG used to build the distanca matrix for the NJ tree
<h4>Dir Alignments:</h4> Single-OG alignments, comprehending all sequences before subsampling (see Materials and Methods). All alignments were later merged and realigned altogehter with MAFFT-DASH, previous to ML tree inference
